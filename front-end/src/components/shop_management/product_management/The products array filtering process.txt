The array filtering process in the filterProducts function is performed using the filter() method, which is a built-in JavaScript method for arrays.

Here's the relevant code snippet:

return products.filter((product) => {
  return isSeasonMatch() && isTypeMatch() && isOnSaleMatch() && isCalificationMatch();
});

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the filtering process:

The filter() method is called on the products array, which contains the list of products to be filtered.
The filter() method takes a callback function as an argument, which is called for each element in the products array.
The callback function takes a single argument, product, which represents the current product being processed.
The callback function calls four other functions: isSeasonMatch(), isTypeMatch(), isOnSaleMatch(), and isCalificationMatch(). Each of these functions checks whether the current product matches a specific filter criterion.
The results of these four function calls are combined using the logical && operator, which returns true only if all four conditions are true.
If the combined result is true, the current product is included in the filtered array. If the result is false, the product is excluded from the filtered array.
The filter() method returns a new array containing only the products that passed the filter criteria.
The four filter functions (isSeasonMatch(), isTypeMatch(), isOnSaleMatch(), and isCalificationMatch()) are defined earlier in the filterProducts function and perform the following checks:

isSeasonMatch(): Checks whether the product's season matches the selected season filter.
isTypeMatch(): Checks whether the product's type matches the selected type filter.
isOnSaleMatch(): Checks whether the product is on sale (i.e., its discount price is greater than 0).
isCalificationMatch(): Checks whether the product's calification matches the selected calification filter.
By combining the results of these four filter functions, the filterProducts function returns a filtered array of products that match all the selected filter criteria.
